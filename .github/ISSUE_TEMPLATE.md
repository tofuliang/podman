BUG REPORT INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------------
Use the commands below to provide key information from your environment:

**NOTE** A large number of issues reported against Podman are often found to already be fixed
in more current versions of the project.  Before reporting an issue, please verify the
version you are running with `podman version` and compare it to the latest release
documented on the top of Podman's [README.md](../README.md).  If they differ, please
update your version of Podman to the latest possible and retry your command before creating
an issue.

Also, there is a running list of known issues in the [Podman Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/troubleshooting.md),
please reference that page before opening a new issue.

If you are filing a bug against `podman build`, please instead file a bug
against Buildah (https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues). Podman build
executes Buildah to perform container builds, and as such the Buildah
maintainers are best equipped to handle these bugs.
